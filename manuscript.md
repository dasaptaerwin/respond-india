India’s one nation - one subscription: could it support resilience in academic publishing?
===

>The coin of science has two sides: head to represent personal glory and tail to represent other stuff. We flip that coin and the head always shows up. About India’s one nation one subscription

Basically the Indian government is planning to make scholarly literature available for access via [nationwide subscription](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02708-4) under a transformative agreement with the world’s biggest scientific publishers to give India researchers and common citizen access to knowledge. India has been [estimated to allocate 60%](https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&series=GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS&country=IND) of its GDP for Research and Development budget in 2018, according to World Bank data. Indonesia allocates only 20% in the same year. 

> Initially the subscriptions have been paid by various research and education institutions with a rough estimation of 15 billion rupees or equivalent to USD 200 million each year. As two examples, [CeRA consortium](http://cera.iari.res.in/index.php/en/) had spent Rs. 605,997,009 (USD ???) from 2007 to 2014, while the budget spent by [ICAR](https://www.icar.org.in/content/consortium-e-resources-agriculture-cera) was USD 882,731 in 2014 (**note: Sridhar is rechecking the numbers**). 

[A report released in  2019](https://www.ias.ac.in/public/Resources/News/OpenAccess.pdf) mentioned the following numbers. During  2010-2014, Indian researchers had published a total of 15,400 OA papers were published with total APC paid around USD 2.4 M (Around Rs. 20 cores). Moreover in 2018, as much as Rs. 1200 cores were spent for  electronic journal subscription and Rs. 1500 cores for subscriptions to these-and/or printed journals. As for SCOPUS and Web of Science, India had spent Rs. 30 to 50 crores that can only be accessed by only limited number of researchers working in top institutions.

Under the new plan, The Ministry of Science and Technology will centralised the payment for the subscription. Although we haven’t found any trusted number on the budget, the nationwide agreement is expected to cut down the spending on subscription journals. 

Apart from the expensive national OA plan, while there had been concerns of predatory journals, actually India has worked hard in providing OA scientific materials for its citizen, in form of the [increasing number of scientific journals and institutional repositories](https://www.natureasia.com/en/nindia/article/10.1038/nindia.2020.125). [In early 2019, there were 273 Indian journals on the DOAJ list. Most of them didn't charge APC (article processing fee) to authors. As a sign of global context, there were 135 local and regional journals archived by Pubmed Central (PMC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6624418/). 


#### Comments from the editor

* under the new policy? who will pay for it? the government? and who will benefit? 

> our response: ... under a transformative agreement with the world’s biggest scientific publishers to give India researchers and common citizen access to knowledge. ... Under the new plan, The Ministry of Science and Technology will centralised the payment for the subscription. This agreement is expected to cut down the spending on subscription journals.   `

* it important to also note in the introduction part, the fact about India, its global position in the research, scholarly communities, how influential is the nation?

* I think it is better to mention about the ongoing debate on whether to have open access or paying commercial publishers to open their paywall?

> our response: we did write about the ongoing debate

* and how India's case may resolve this debate?

> our response: We need to write our conclusion, that India's case won't solve the debate, since it's still in favour of commercial publishers. Again India's case would only add the winning list of commercial publishers

# The open access debates

The debates of paying commercial publishers to open their paywall to articles or to make the articles open access are as ancient as the epic tale of Ramayana and Mahabrata. It has been an all time war between [common scientists battling the commercial publisher giants](https://www.norrag.org/the-cost-of-knowledge-education-unions-unite-against-the-privatisation-of-scholarly-research-by-jon-tennant/).     

Although academic publishers are commonly thought as stakeholders in science, many open access supporters [put them as service providers](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0010.309?view=text;rgn=main) who work in the packaging section in the research production line.

However the debates may also have been rooted to the domination of perspective from physical/quantitative science, with [the invention of the internet](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2016.1157619) and the founding of [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org), while significant OA movements were also [built upon significant works in social sciences and humanities](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.24306) ([OA version](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:27005/)), in the form of printed article and book publication by independent  publishers or self publishing since early 80’s.

Given the situation where academia is in the midst of commercialization, OA is not limited to with-APC journal publication. At the end, they are only the customer of the publication industry. This has made a problematic situation where [the state will be the party to spend money the most and commercial publishers will be the ones who take the most benefit](https://rinarxiv.lipi.go.id/lipi/preprint/view/9). France is one of the countries that has released [comprehensive policies](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/open-science/) on opening the access of their public funded research, from upstream to downstream by maximizing internal capacity. 

We also see there is massive untapped potential in universities lacking in research infrastructure to contribute to global knowledge generation. This was just one issue that were submitted in [UNESCO Asia-Pacific Online Regional Consultation on Open Science held on September 15th, 2020](https://en.unesco.org/news/asia-pacific-online-regional-consultation-towards-unesco-recommendation-open-science).  

India's plan to have a nationwide subscription won't solve the this ongoing debate, since it's still in favour of commercial publishers. Again India's case would only add the winning list of commercial publishers over common scientists. 


# How this plan impact the commercial journal publishers worldwide

This plan should change how commercial publisher giants in dealing with low to middle income countries. 

They shouldn’t put profit motivation as the first consideration if they would like to keep their role as a member of the stakeholders of science. Turning public knowledge to branded products, [using an open access model or subscription-based model](https://elephantinthelab.org/do-we-need-an-open-science-coalition/), will prevent science from progressing further and faster especially in under-represented countries. 

Lack of funding to pay subscriptions, to pay APC and to set up proper research infrastructure has systematically created a massive inequality in the production of scientific papers. In earth science for instance, the top 10 most productive countries in [publication according to Scopus (2019)](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7rsj5/) are those residing in European continent, United States, and Australia. Such a database only captures papers written in English, therefore it fails to show the scientific diversity of science written in a second language. [Language discrimination is the second thing to tackle since English is not the first nor the second language for scientific communication](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/object/355/download/737/). 

Commercial publishers must stop putting prestige to resemble quality in the mind of researchers. This act will only make [The Berlin wall of prestige](https://github.com/dasaptaerwin/oaspa2020-berlinwall) even taller and stronger. They should not dictate how to build a sustainable scientific community since in fact, they solely care about their profits. On the other hands, governments and scientific communities should work together to define what they mean by credible, equitable, and sustainable research culture and how to maintain it sustainable. Perhaps, we could start lowering the barriers by making research infrastructure widely available, promoting openness and transparency as the core scientific values, and allowing cooperative behaviours instead of encouraging unhealthy competitions between scientists.

As public funds for research are extremely limited, developing countries like India and Indonesia are forced to make a bargain with commercial publishers. Government should start acting strategically by strengthening solidarity and collective effort aside from bargaining with commercial publishers.


# Closing

We're not going anywhere towards building resilience in academic publishing if the government as the most important stakeholder constantly chooses the route to pay for external services instead of building the internal capacity of the nation. It’s not merely a problem of how much we spend for the APC or journal subscription per year. Beyond that, it’s a problem of making the wheels work, not reinventing them.
