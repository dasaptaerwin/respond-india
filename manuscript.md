India’s one nation - one subscription: could it support resilience in academic publishing?
===

>The coin of science has two sides: head to represent personal glory and tail to represent common . We flip that coin and the head always shows up.
About India’s one nation one subscription

Basically the Indian government is planning to make scholarly literature available for access via [nationwide subscription](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02708-4) under a transformative agreement with the world’s biggest scientific publishers. Initially the subscriptions have been paid by various research and education institutions with a rough estimation of 15 billion rupees or equivalent to USD 200 million each year. As two examples, [CeRA consortium](http://cera.iari.res.in/index.php/en/) had spent Rs. 605,997,009 (USD ???) from 2007 to 2014, while the budget spent by [ICAR](https://www.icar.org.in/content/consortium-e-resources-agriculture-cera) was USD 882,731 in 2014. The nationwide agreement is expected to cut down the spending on subscription journals. `Sridhar is rechecking the numbers`

# The open access debates

The debates of paying commercial publishers to open their paywall to articles or to make the articles open access are as ancient as the epic tale of Ramayana and Mahabrata. It has been an all time war between [common scientists battling the commercial publisher giants](https://www.norrag.org/the-cost-of-knowledge-education-unions-unite-against-the-privatisation-of-scholarly-research-by-jon-tennant/).     

Although academic publishers are commonly thought as stakeholders in science, many open access supporters [put them as service providers](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0010.309?view=text;rgn=main) who work in the packaging section in the research production line.

However the debates may also have been rooted to the domination of perspective from physical/quantitative science, with [the invention of the internet](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2016.1157619) and the founding of [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org), while significant OA movements were also [built upon significant works in social sciences and humanities](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.24306) ([OA version](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:27005/), in the form of printed article and book publication by independent  publishers or self publishing since early 80’s.

Given the situation where academia is in the midst of commercialization, OA is not limited to with-APC journal publication. At the end, they are only the customer of the publication industry. This has made a problematic situation where [the state will be the party to spend money the most and commercial publishers will be the ones who take the most benefit](https://rinarxiv.lipi.go.id/lipi/preprint/view/9). France is one of the countries that has released [comprehensive policies](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/open-science/) on opening the access of their public funded research, from upstream to downstream by maximizing internal capacity. 

We also see there is massive untapped potential in universities lacking in research infrastructure to contribute to global knowledge generation. This was just one issue that had been submitted in [UNESCO Asia-Pacific Online Regional Consultation on Open Science held on September 15th, 2020](https://en.unesco.org/news/asia-pacific-online-regional-consultation-towards-unesco-recommendation-open-science).  

# How this plan impact the commercial journal publishers worldwide

This plan should change how commercial publisher giants in dealing with low to middle income countries. They shouldn’t put profit motivation as the first consideration if they would like to keep their role as a member of the stakeholders of science. Turning public knowledge to branded products, [using an open access model or subscription-based model](https://elephantinthelab.org/do-we-need-an-open-science-coalition/), will prevent science from progressing further and faster especially in under-represented countries. 

Lack of funding to pay subscriptions, to pay APC and to set up proper research infrastructure has systematically created a massive inequality in the production of scientific papers. In earth science for instance, the top 10 most productive countries in [publication according to Scopus (2019)](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7rsj5/) are those residing in European continent, United States, and Australia. Such a database only captures papers written in English, therefore it fails to show the scientific diversity of science written in a second language. [Language discrimination is the second thing to tackle since English is not the first nor the second language for scientific communication](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/object/355/download/737/). 

Commercial publishers must stop putting prestige to resemble quality in the mind of researchers. This act will only make [The Berlin wall of prestige](https://github.com/dasaptaerwin/oaspa2020-berlinwall) even taller and stronger.

# Closing

We're not going anywhere towards building resilience in academic publishing if the government as the most important stakeholder constantly chooses the route to pay for external services instead of building the internal capacity of the nation. It’s not merely a problem of how much we spend for the APC or journal subscription per year. Beyond that, it’s a problem of making the wheels work, not reinventing them.
