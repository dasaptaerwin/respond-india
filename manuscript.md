India’s plan to pay subscription fees for all its citizen may harm the norm  of making science available for everyone

India, the world's second most populous country, is planning to make [scholarly literature available for everyone](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02708-4) under its latest science, technology and innovation policy.

The policy will push for the whole country to have a nationwide subscription to replace existing subscriptions paid by different research and education institutions to access research journals. The Indian government is in talks with the world's top scientific publications to create the system.

If it works, India would become the largest country to give access to paywalled journal articles to more than 1.3 billion of its citizens.

Many scientists have responded positively to the plan as it offers a new strategy in which governments play an important role to ensure that scholarly literature is accessible for everyone.

However, this plan may harm the spirit of making science and knowledge available for everyone under an open science mechanism.


## Saving the budget

In 2018, India has [allocated 0.6%](https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&series=GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS&country=IND) of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for research and development (R/D) budget From 2014 to 2017, India spent averagely 0.7% for its GDP for  R/D.  Indonesia, as an example, has spent on average 0.2% of GDP from 2016 to 2018. 

For subscription alone, India spent [15 billion rupees or equivalent to USD 200 million](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02708-4) paid by different research and education institutions to access research journals. As an example, National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP) has established the [Consortium for e-Resources in Agriculture (CeRA)](https://www.naip.icar.gov.in/download/77209/final-cerareport.pdf/final-cerareport.pdf) in November 2007 to provide access to subscription-based journals. From August 2007 to December 2011, [they had spent Rs. 938.542 lakhs or USD 1.2 million ](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-35233-1_33).


**how much this plan will save the cost?**

Under One Nation-One Subscription plan, major scientific publications are encouraged to put aside profits in their deals if they would like to keep their role as an important stakeholder in the development of science.

Selling knowledge at a high price will prevent science from progressing further and faster especially in under-represented countries.

Data has shown how limited access to paid journal subscriptions and databases has led to a massive  inequality in the production of scientific papers. In earth science, for instance, the top 10 most productive countries in [publication according to Scopus (2019)](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7rsj5/) are those residing in European countries, United States and Australia.  These papers are only written in English, therefore it fails to show the diversity of science written in a second language.

India's model should also introduce the role of the government to facilitate the availability of scientific  journals for all citizens.

In many developing countries, budgets for research are very limited. In 2020, Indonesia has allocated IDR 1.2 T (or USD 81 million)  . India's story shows the importance of the government to make a bargain with commercial publishers. With such limited budget, government should start acting strategically by strengthening capacity  by [promoting good research practices](https://fit4rri.eu/rri4real/) instead of promoting false metric, [broadening creativity](https://theconversation.com/when-artists-get-involved-in-research-science-benefits-82147)  and [collective effort](https://www.deepseanews.com/2018/11/tipping-points-for-profit-scientific-publishing-and-closed-science/) aside from bargaining with commercial publishers which would bring us the [tipping point of making profit from public funded research and closing science](https://www.deepseanews.com/2018/11/tipping-points-for-profit-scientific-publishing-and-closed-science/).

## Harming (open) science norm

India's plan should also indicate that commercial publishers are winning over the application of the open access system to make scholarly literature available for everyone. 

The debates between making scholarly journals available for everyone by paying commercial publishers to open up their paywalls and re-allocating such budgets for building internal capacity are as ancient as the epic tale of Ramayana and Mahabrata. It has been an all time war between [scientists battling the commercial publisher giants](https://www.norrag.org/the-cost-of-knowledge-education-unions-unite-against-the-privatisation-of-scholarly-research-by-jon-tennant/). India's plan to have a nationwide subscription won't end this ongoing [science ethicality debate](https://forbetterscience.com/2018/09/11/response-to-plan-s-from-academic-researchers-unethical-too-risky/), since it's still in favour of commercial publishers. 

At the end, we are only the customer of the publication industry. This has made a problematic situation where [the state will be the party to spend money the most and commercial publishers will be the ones who take the most benefit](https://rinarxiv.lipi.go.id/lipi/preprint/view/9). France is one of the countries that has released [comprehensive policies](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/open-science/) on opening the access of their public funded research, from upstream to downstream by maximizing internal capacity. One of the reason for such situation is the [wild-goose chase towards World Class University](http://www.shanghairanking.com/wcu/wcu4/18.pdf) which frequently missing [its cost and benefit considerations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270112083_The_Costs_and_Benefits_of_World-Class_Universities) to common society, not only for the interested research and education institutions.  The government should also put [a proper Return on Investment/ROI analysis](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000248150) for any programs targeting world class rank.    

We're not going anywhere towards making knowledge available for everyone if the government as the most important stakeholder constantly chooses the route to pay for external services instead of building the internal capacity of the nation by supporting Indonesia’s researchers  to publish their results as wide as possible using [available local and international open  infrastructure](https://elephantinthelab.org/challenges-in-building-innovative-sustainable-and-open-research-infrastructures/). This would also build resilience in the academic publishing system. 

Another un-discussed issue is who holds the copyrights upon the opening access to what once was paywalled scientific materials. Open Access in science should also mean freedom for researchers in retaining the copyrights of their published manuscripts, as has been mandated by funders or government, such as [India](https://indiabioscience.org/columns/indian-scenario/making-indian-science-more-open-and-accessible) and [Indonesia (National System for Science and Technology Law No. 11/2019)](https://indiabioscience.org/columns/indian-scenario/making-indian-science-more-open-and-accessible). 
The Government instead of making it mandatory to post/deposit the research outputs in institutional repositories like [University Grants Commission’s](https://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/4952604_UGC-(M.PHIL.-PH.D-DEGREES)-REGULATIONS,-2016.pdf) mandatory deposition of thesis for the award of PhD degrees is working on subscribing to the research published. The taxpayers have to pay for the research and also for accessing the same. The repositories in India are poorly filled. The [ScienceCentral.in](http://sciencecentral.in/index.jsp) deposits (3621) has only 69% full-texts and the leading academy, [Indian Academy of Sciences](http://repository.ias.ac.in/cgi/stats/report) has only 21% full-texts out of the 1,06,364 deposits.
